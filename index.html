                <p>The problem we are trying to solve is unemployment. And in most cases when we are talking about being 
                 employed all we think about is working for a
                  certain company or person. So we came up with an idea to build a website that will educate
                   unemployed people about being an entrepreneur and empower them to build their own companies
                    or sites. On this website we are trying to make the rate of unemployment decrease. This website
                     will have an educate section where people will be able to learn about how to become an entrepreneur.
                      And there will also be a funder section where you will get information about the funder so that you 
                      can apply for business to get funding.
                </p>
                <div class="text">Entrepreneur</div>
                <p>An entrepreneur is an individual who takes the risk to start their own business based on an idea they have
                    or a product they have created while assuming most of the risks and reaping most of the rewards of the business.
                    Entrepreneurs frequently want change, not only change, they also want to be the bearers of change. They are solution 
                    givers and want to interrupt the status . They have a vision like "I want to assemble the world's information" or 
                    "I want to put an AC at every desk" and they take an attempt to make this change. In this attempt, some succeed and some fail.</p>
